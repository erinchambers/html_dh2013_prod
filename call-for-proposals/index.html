                design and modeling;</li>

            <p>We particularly welcome submissions on interdisciplinary work and new developments in the field, and

            <p>Presentations may include:</p>

              <li>posters (abstract max of 750 words);</li>

              available on the conference site at the beginning of October 2012: <a
                href="../index.html">https://dh2013.unl.edu/</a> Previous DH conference participants and reviewers
              should use their existing accounts rather than setting up new ones. If you have forgotten your user name
              or password, please contact Program Committee chair Bethany Nowviskie at bethany@virginia.edu.</p>
            <p><strong>II. Types of Proposals</strong></p>
            <p>Proposals may be of five types: (1) poster presentations; (2) short paper presentations; (3) long
              papers; (4) three-paper or full panel sessions; and (5) proposals for pre-conference workshops and
              tutorials. Based on peer review and its mandate to create a balanced and varied program, the Program
              Committee may offer acceptance in a different category from the one initially proposed, and will
              normally not accept multiple submissions from the same author or group of authors. Papers and posters
              may be given in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish.</p>
            <p>1) Poster Presentations</p>
            <p>Poster proposals (500 to 750 words) may describe work on any topic of the call for papers or offer
              project and software demonstrations. Posters and demonstrations are intended to be interactive, with the
              opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one with attendees. In addition to a dedicated session, when
              presenters will explain their work and answer questions, posters will be on display at various times
              during the conference.</p>
            <p>2) Short Papers</p>
            <p>Short paper proposals (750 to 1500 words) are appropriate for reporting on experiments or work in
              progress, or for describing newly conceived tools or software in early stages of development. This
              category of presentation allows for up to five short papers in a single session, with the length held to
              a strict 10 minutes each in order to allow time for questions.</p>
            <p>3) Long Papers</p>
            <p>Proposals for long papers (750 to 1500 words) are appropriate for: substantial, completed, and
              previously unpublished research; reports on the development of significant new methodologies or digital
              resources; and/or rigorous theoretical, speculative, or critical discussions. Individual papers will be
              allocated 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for questions.</p>
            <p>Proposals about the development of new computing methodologies or digital resources should indicate how
              the methods are applied to research and/or teaching in the humanities, what their impact has been in
              formulating and addressing research questions, and should include critical assessment of their
              application in the humanities. Papers that concentrate on a particular tool or digital resource in the
              humanities should cite traditional as well as computer-based approaches to the problem and should
              include critical assessments of the computing methodologies used. All proposals should include relevant
              citations to sources in the literature.</p>
            <p>4) Multiple Paper Sessions</p>
            <p>These consist of one 90-minute panel of four to six speakers, or three long papers on a single theme.
              Panel organizers should submit an abstract of 750 to 1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will
              be organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that each speaker is willing to
              participate in the session. Paper session organizers should submit a statement of approximately 500
              words describing the session topic, include abstracts of 750 to 1500 words for each paper, and indicate
              that each author is willing to participate in the session. Papers that are submitted as part of a
              special session may not be submitted individually for consideration in another category.</p>
            <p>5) Pre-Conference Workshops and Tutorials</p>
            <p>Participants in pre-conference workshops or tutorials will be expected to register for the full
              conference as well as pay a small additional fee.</p>
            <p>Proposals should provide the following information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a title and brief description of the content or topic and its relevance to the DH community (not
                more than 1500 words);</li>
              <li>full contact information for all tutorial instructors or workshop leaders, including a one-paragraph
                statement of their research interests and areas of expertise;</li>
              <li>a description of target audience and expected number of participants (based, if possible, on past
                experience);</li>
              <li>and any special requirements for technical support.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, tutorial proposals should include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a brief outline showing that the core content can be covered in a half day (approximately 3 hours,
                plus breaks). In exceptional cases, full-day tutorials may be supported as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And workshop proposals must include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the intended length and format of the workshop (minimum half-day; maximum one and a half days);</li>
              <li>a proposed budget (as DH workshops are expected to be self-financing) (<a
                  href="../room-technology-and-food-costs-for-workshops/index.html">see room and food cost
                  information</a>);</li>
              <li>and, if the workshop is to have its own CFP, a deadline and date for notification of acceptances,
                and a list of individuals who have agreed to be part of the workshop&#8217;s program committee.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>III. Information about the Conference Venue and Theme</strong></p>
            <p>DH 2013 (&#8220;Freedom to Explore&#8221;) will take place in Lincoln, Nebraska, a capital city of
              258,000 people on the Great Plains of the United States. Lincoln is known for its artistic treasures,
              live music scene, fabulous trails, and friendly Midwestern attitude. It is also the home of the
              University of Nebraska-Lincoln, chartered in 1869 as both a land-grant and a research university.
              UNL&#8217;s approximately 25,000 students come from about 120 different countries. Among its many degree
              offerings is an interdisciplinary graduate certificate in digital humanities. The Center for Digital
              Research in the Humanities is this year’s local organizer: <a

            <p><strong>IV. Bursaries for young scholars</strong></p>
            <p>The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations will offer a limited number of bursaries for
              early-career scholars presenting at the conference. Application guidelines will appear on the ADHO
              website later this year: <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org">http://www.digitalhumanities.org</a>
