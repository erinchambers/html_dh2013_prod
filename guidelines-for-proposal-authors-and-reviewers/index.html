          <div class="entry-content">
            <h2 class="h3">Authors</h2>
            <p>All proposals should conform to the specified length and other requirements indicated in the call for
              papers. Additionally, they should express a clear argument and/or present new information which may be
              of value to the audience; they should not be simply summaries of events or statements of fact. Papers
              which only report on the activities of a project, without drawing conclusions or exploring the
              significance of those activities, will be at a disadvantage in the review process.</p>
            <p>It is extremely important to include adequate references, both to establish the field within which your
              proposal participates, and to substantiate and document any claims you may make. If a proposal makes no
              use of outside sources, it is possibly too vague to be successful; if it uses outside sources then it is
              incumbent on the author to reference them.</p>
            <p>In-text referencing is included in the word count, but the list of references at the end of the
              abstract does not count towards the word limit. All listed references should be cited within the text.
            </p>
            <p>Newly to the DH conference this year, you will be allotted a 2-week period in December in which to
              offer a very brief, optional response to your proposal’s peer reviews. You may choose to provide
              additional information to the international Program Committee or indicate how you would address
              reviewers’ concerns, and your comments and assessment of the reviews themselves will be considered by
              the PC as it makes its final determination of the content of the program. Authors will be notified by
              email when the system has been re-opened for this response period.</p>
            <h2 class="h3">Reviewers</h2>
            <p>The role of the reviewer is to assist the Program Committee in assessing the quality of proposals
              submitted. Reviews do not wholly determine which proposals will be accepted or rejected, but rather
              provide expert information which the PC uses in making its decisions. The second major role for
              reviewers is to provide helpful, constructive feedback to authors, which can strengthen both the quality
              of the conference and the collegiality and intellectual rigor of the digital humanities.</p>
            <p>A good review will suggest concrete ways in which the proposal may be strengthened. This feedback is
              important whether you are recommending that the paper or poster be rejected or accepted. If the former,
              it will enable the author to submit a stronger proposal next year (and may encourage and benefit a new
              member or a young scholar); if the latter, it will result in a stronger paper being presented. In either
              case, constructive criticism projects collegiality and an interest in others&#8217; work.</p>
            <p>Whatever you may think privately of the proposal or project, and whatever you may know (or think you
              know) about the author, it is essential that you be uncompromisingly professional and courteous in
              reviewing all submissions. Rudeness of any sort is destructive to the morale of the community and is
              absolutely unacceptable in a review. Comments which are purely negative should be addressed solely to
              the program committee.</p>
            <p>To a certain extent, given the small size of the DH conference community, the identity of paper authors
              has often been evident to an astute reviewer, and discretion has always been required in handling that
              knowledge appropriately. Since ADHO has discontinued the anonymization of papers during the review
              process (moving to single-blind review), this discretion has become even more necessary.</p>
            <p>The identity of an author will necessarily be a factor in evaluating the proposal, but it may operate
              in complex ways. A famous name should not be taken as de facto evidence of a strong proposal, and a weak
              proposal by such an author should be given the same critique as a weak proposal by an unknown author.
              However, there may also be cases where an author&#8217;s known expertise may strengthen the value of the
              proposal: for instance, a representative of a standards workgroup might have more credibility in
              discussing the standard than someone with no involvement in the effort. Reviewers should feel free to be
              candid in their comments to the Program Committee in cases where they feel the identity of the author
              plays a significant role in the assessment of the paper.</p>
            <p>Newly to the DH conference this year, you will be allowed to read comments by others who have been
              assigned to assess the same submission. These peer reviews will only be visible after you have submitted
              your own review, and all will remain anonymous. Reviewers are expected to assess each contribution
              independently, on its own merits, and are asked not to address other reviewers’ comments directly. If,
              however, you are prompted to think more deeply and augment the text of your own review after reading
              peer assessments, you are welcome to do so up to the review deadline, and are expected to justify any
              scoring change in the text of your review.</p>
            <p>Deadline for reviews is Friday, December 14th.</p>
