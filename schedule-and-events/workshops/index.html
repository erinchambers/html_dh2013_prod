            <h2 class="h3" id="alloy">Alloy - Full Day</h2>
            <p><strong>C. M. Sperberg-McQueen</strong>, Information-technology consultant, Black Mesa Technologies,
              LLC</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Description</h3>
            <p>Taking modeling seriously, A hands-on introduction to Alloy</p>
            <p>This one-day tutorial introduces digital humanists to the use of Alloy for modeling. Alloy is a
              language for describing structures and a tool for visualizing hierarchies and relationships associated
              with a data model. This workshop will introduce Alloy&#8217;s internal logic, summarize how its syntax
              works, and describe individual test cases for Alloy as a tool.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>The target audience consists of digital humanists interested in techniques for formalizing important
              concepts and tools for working with such formalizations. The tutorial deals with high level data
              modeling concepts.  Some prior exposure to symbolic logic and/or programming is desirable; failing that,
              highly motivated participants may be able to benefit from the workshop if they have sufficiently high
              tolerance for exposure to new material. Participants should bring a laptop computer with a current
              installation of Java; they may optionally pre- install Alloy 4.2 or they may install it during the
              workshop.</p>
            <h2 class="h3" id="heurist">Heurist - Half Day Morning</h2>
            <p><strong>Ian Johnson</strong>, Director, Arts eResearch, University of Sydney</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Description</h3>
            <p>Heurist is a database tool that hides the complexity of database design behind a simple web interface.
              It allows researchers to create complex databases rapidly, without using a programming language. In this
              workshop participants will learn how to build a Heurist online database to support a small research
              project, and end up with a fully operational, web-accessible, private or shared database on a hosted
              server. After the workshop, they will be able to create additional databases and/or download the open
              source software for installation on an institutional or cloud-based server.</p>
            <p>By the end of the workshop participants will be confident to use the web interface to create new
              databases online, import templates, make changes to database structure, edit and import data, search for
              and save subsets of the data, map, export and transform data, and publish data feeds within a website.
            </p>
            <p>Heurist has been developed across a number of Australian Research Council research grants in the
              Humanities to support a wide range of research, from the production of large historical encyclopaedias
              with an editorial team, such as the Dictionary of Sydney (dictionaryofsydney.org), through
              archaeological survey and excavation databases to individual text markup projects.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>The workshop will be relevant to a wide range of Humanities researchers, but particularly to scholars
              who deal with collections of richly interlinked data. These may include historical individuals,
              organisations and events, inscriptions, manuscripts and archival records, theatrical performances,
              places, buildings, artefacts, images and bibliographic information. It will be particularly relevant to
              scholars who do not have good institutional backing for eResearch tools and database development. No
              programming or technical skills are required to complete the workshop.</p>

            </p>
            <h3 class="h4">Description</h3>
            <p>Annotation is a well-established set of practices that supports digital humanities scholarship. Over
              the course of this half-day workshop we will examine the current and prospective role of annotation in
              digital humanities scholarship and investigate the potential utility of the Open Annotation data model
              recently released by the W3C Open Annotation Community Group.</p>
            <p>Participants will consider whether this specification can help encourage the extension of existing
              tools and the development of new more robust, interoperable web-based annotation tools and services in
              ways that can better meet the needs of the digital humanities scholarly community. Please visit <a

              for more information on the Using Open Annotation Workshop.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>We anticipate an audience of digital humanities tool and web service developers and technology managers
              responsible for digital library services, scholarly discourse services, note-taking software and similar
              web-based applications. Registration is open (i.e., non-competitive) until full.</p>
            <p>Requirements: Prior to the workshop, each participant will be asked to submit a brief (1 to 2 page)
              summary giving their initial reaction to the Open Annotation data model in the context of a specific
              annotation application, research requirement or use case drawn from his or her own scholarship.
              Participant summaries should be submitted to <a
                href="mailto:openannotation@gmail.com">openannotation@gmail.com</a> by no later than 15 June. All
              briefs submitted will be posted on a workshop website (to be maintained by the Open Annotation
              Collaboration), and a subset of these will be presented by participants and discussed during the
              workshop. In addition the workshop leaders will present results from several of the concrete annotation
              demonstration experiments conducted over the last 18 months by the Open Annotation Collaboration. The
              current status of web-based digital annotation tools, services, practices and communities will be
              reviewed with the goal of illuminating critical facets of infrastructure beyond the scope of the Open
              Annotation data model or areas of the data model which require further refinement. Outcomes from the
              Workshop will help identify potential priorities and future directions for the W3C Open Annotation
              Community Group. Participants will gain a better understanding of the Open Annotation data model, its
              implementation, and its potential as a resource supportive of their future work.</p>

            <p><strong>Lisa M. Snyder</strong>, senior member of the Urban Simulation Team at UCLA</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Description</h3>
            <p>VSim: A new interface for integrating real-time exploration of three-dimensional content into
              humanities research and pedagogy</p>
            <p>VSim provides a much-needed real-time interface for academics working with 3D content. It allows users
              three modes of navigation, includes a mechanism for creating linear narratives through the virtual world
              that can be augmented by text and images (think PowerPoint or Prezi in 3D space), and provides a way for
              content creators to link to primary and secondary resources from within the modeled environment. Through
              these two features – the narratives and embedded resources – VSim provides scholars, educators, and
              students the opportunity to build knowledge through exploration of the virtual world as never before
              possible. It responds to the needs of in- service educators by supporting both teacher-centered
              presentations and student-centered exploration, providing the opportunity for students to actively
              engage with the content to build knowledge by creating a personalized virtual learning environment. And
              most importantly, VSim breaks down the barriers to instructional use of 3D content by providing a simple
              interface that easily re-purposes the crowd-sourced computer models built for Google Earth and available
              in the Google/Trimble 3D Warehouse.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>The proposed half-day tutorial will introduce VSim to interested humanities scholars. The target
              audience includes academics across the humanities disciplines who are working with 3D content,
              supervising students on historic reconstruction projects, using available 3D content to supplement their
              ongoing research activities, or interested in integrating computer models into their seminars,
              classrooms, and conference presentations. Interest in this tutorial is difficult to predict, so has been
              organized to work whether capped at 20-25 to ensure individualized attention to each participant or
              opened up to a larger audience. (The only impact to being flexible is the size of the volunteer pool for
              the participant presentations scheduled towards the end of the tutorial.) The need for an advance CFP is
              not anticipated.</p>

            <p><strong>Nick Laiacona</strong>, President of Performant Software Solutions LLC<br />
              <strong>Gregor Middell</strong>, Literary Scholar &amp; Software Developer
            </p>
            <h3 class="h4">Description</h3>
            <p>In this workshop, participants will learn how to develop a customized collation pipeline in Ruby using
              Juxta WS. Juxta WS is a web service that can collate variant texts and visualize the differences between
              them. It is free, open-source software comprising a pipeline of “micro-services” that may be valuable to
              any project that deals with digital texts, especially texts encoded in XML.</p>
            <p>In the first half of the workshop, participants will follow along on their laptops as we introduce
              Juxta WS and the constituent parts of the collation pipeline. In the second half of the workshop, we
              will begin by showing participants how to obtain texts for experimentation from online sources. We will
              then have a hacking session where participants will work in small groups to leverage Juxta WS on texts
              from their own projects or obtained online.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>This workshop is intended for software developers with a basic working knowledge of XML and Ruby.
              Knowledge of TEI is optional. It will be of interest to developers working on any text-based project,
              but especially editorial projects, projects handling variant texts, and projects dealing with XML
              encoded texts, including TEI.</p>
            <p>Prerequisites: Workshop participants should bring:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A working knowledge of Ruby. Suggested reading: (<a

            <p><strong>Nancy Maron</strong>, Program Director, Ithaka S+R</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Description</h3>
            <p>This half-day tutorial will introduce project leaders to the basics of sustainability planning, help
              them establish ambitious but realistic sustainability goals, define the challenges they face, and sketch
              out a hypothesis of their ideal funding model. The workshop will include group participation and will
              share real-world examples, illustrated by case studies of projects that really worked, or …didn’t. The
              session will also allow participants to review the ‘Funding Model Framework,’ a tool designed by Ithaka
              S+R to help guide those leading digital resource projects in choosing and testing the funding strategies
              that will work best for them.</p>
            <p>We hope that by introducing new some ideas and practical tools in a supportive and engaging setting,
              this tutorial will encourage digital humanities project leaders in developing and testing new ideas to
              support their work.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>Participants of this tutorial should be those with interest in and/or responsibility for charting a
              course for the development of a digital scholarly project or resource. This could include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Academic project leaders who are leading or have created a digital resource.</li>
              <li>Managers of digital collections and digitization units at cultural organizations, including museums,
                libraries, archives and other institutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Those in early stages of considering sustainability strategies for their projects are encouraged to

            <p>Keywords to Keyframes: Video Analytics for Archival Research</p>
            <p>This workshop will serve scholars of any level of technical expertise who are interested in studying
              images as part of their work in the digital humanities using a hybrid method that combines machine
              analytics (keyframes) and crowd-sourced tagging (keywords). Facilitating a discussion and training
              session featuring up to twenty participants, we will demo the Large Scale Video Analytics (LSVA)
              workbench for moving and still image analysis and archiving.</p>
            <p>The LSVA is a web portal developed through a collaboration among the National Center for Supercomputing
              Applications (NCSA) and the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), the IML
              (Institute for Multimedia Literacy), and ICHASS (the Institute for Computing in the Humanities, Arts and
              Social Science). The LSVA has customized the prominent Medici content management system, a multimedia
              database which has served scholars worldwide. The LSVA requires no software installation, though we do
              require online access. Further, we will provide access to IM2Learn, a free software package for image
              analysis developed by the NCSA.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>The target audience for this workshop consists of scholars with research interests related to the way
              that visual media impacts culture.</p>

            </p>
            <h3 class="h4">Description</h3>
            <p>Desktop fabrication is the digitization of analog manufacturing techniques. Comparable to desktop
              publishing, it affords the output of digital content (e.g., 3D models) in physical form (e.g., plastic).
              It also personalizes production through accessible software and hardware, with more flexibility and
              rapidity than its analog predecessors. Additive manufacturing is a process whereby a 3D form is
              constructed by building successive layers of a melted source material (at the moment, this is most often
              some type of plastic). The technology driving additive manufacturing in the desktop fabrication field is
              the 3D printer, tabletop devices that materialize digital 3D models.</p>
            <p>In this workshop, we will introduce technologies used for desktop fabrication and additive
              manufacturing, and offer a possible workflow that bridges the digital and physical worlds for work with
              three­dimensional forms. We will begin by introducing 3D printers, and demonstrate how they operate by
              printing things throughout the event. The software used in controlling the printer and in preparing
              models to print will be explained. We will use free software sources so those in attendance can
              experiment with the tools as they are introduced.</p>
            <p>The main elements of the workshop are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Acquisition of digital 3D models — from online repositories to creating your own with<br />
                photogrammetry, scanning technologies, and modelling software.</li>
              <li>Software to clean and reshape digital models in order to make them print­ready and<br />
                remove artifacts from the scanning process.</li>
              <li>3D printers and the software to control and use them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>Targeted towards scholars interested in learning about technologies surrounding 3D printing and
              additive manufacturing, and for accessible solutions to implementing those technologies in their work.
              Past workshops have been for faculty, graduate and undergraduate students in the humanities; librarians;
              archivists; GLAM professionals; digital humanities centers. This is an introductory workshop, so little
              prior experience is necessary, only a desire to learn and be engaged with the topic.</p>
            <p>Those attending are asked to bring, if possible, a laptop computer to install and run the software
              introduced, and a digital camera or smartphone for experimenting with photogrammetry. Workshop
              facilitators will bring cameras, a 3D printer, plastics, and related materials for the event. By the end
              of the conference, each participant will have the opportunity to print an object for their own use.</p>

            <p>Introduction to the TXM content analysis platform</p>
            <p>The objective of the “introduction to TXM” tutorial is to introduce the participants to the methodology
              of<a href="http://textometrie.ens-lyon.fr/?lang=en"> textometric content analysis</a> through working
              with the TXM software directly on their own laptop computers. At the end of the tutorial, the
              participants will be able to input their own textual corpora (Unicode encoded raw texts or XML tagged
              texts) into TXM and to analyze them with the panel of content analysis tools available : word patterns
              frequency lists, kwic concordances and text browsing, rich full text search engine syntax (allowing to
              express various sequences of word forms, part of speech and lemma combinations constrained by XML
              structures), statistically specific sub-corpus vocabulary analysis, statistical collocation analysis,
              etc.).</p>
            <p>During the tutorial, each participant will install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/txm">TXM</a>
              and the <a href="http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger">TreeTagger lemmatizer</a> on her

            <p>Teaching Text Analysis with Voyant</p>
            <p>One of the common skills covered in introductory digital humanities courses at both the undergraduate
              and graduate levels is computer-assisted text analysis. This workshop will introduce participants to
              ways of teaching text analysis with the online text analysis environment, <a
                href="http://voyant-tools.org">Voyant Tools</a>. Unlike previous workshops that have been focused on
              using Voyant Tools for research, this workshop is aimed at participants who want to introduce text
              analysis into their teaching. Participants are not expected to know much about text analysis or Voyant;
              this workshop will include a brief hands-on component to introduce text analysis with Voyant as an
              example of what can be done.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>Text analysis is about asking questions of a text with the help of a computer. As such it is a research
              method of interest to any who interpret texts.</p>

            <h3 class="h4">Description</h3>
            <p>Designed for humanities scholars seeking assistance with their first grant, this workshop introduces
              participants to best practices in writing and submitting a grant. Participants will be provided with a
              series of online resources, including presentations, exemplar successful grants, and podcasts to help
              them complete a first draft of a proposal before they arrive in Lincoln. Those drafts will be circulated
              to other participants prior to the workshop and will serve as the core basis of our workshop discussions
              with the anticipation being that each participant will receive clear feedback from other attendees that
              will aid them in the revision of their proposal. Drafts will be encouraged to emulate the popular
              National Endowment for the Humanities Digital Humanities Start­up Grant competition in order to provide
              the most flexibility for participants in their digital humanities endeavors. This seminar will be
              limited to 15 participants; additional seminars may be made available should demand necessitate.</p>
            <p>Papers should be 5 to 7 pages in length, double-spaced. We encourage participants to produce shorter
              papers to allow for greater commenting/consideration. Additionally, we want to encourage these papers to
              emulate the narrative section of the National Endowment for Humanities Digital Humanities Start Up
              Grants solicitation, as this competition focuses on humanities significance and innovation and is a
              likely funding source for early development projects. For more information on the composition of the

            <p>Designing successful digital humanities crowdsourcing projects</p>
            <p>Successful crowdsourcing projects help organisations connect with audiences who enjoy engaging with
              their content and tasks, whether transcribing handwritten documents, correcting OCR errors, identifying
              animals on the Serengeti or folding proteins. Conversely, poorly-designed crowdsourcing projects find it
              difficult to attract or retain participants.</p>
            <p>This workshop will present international case studies of best practice crowdsourcing projects to
              illustrate the range of tasks that can be crowdsourced, the motivations of participants and the
              characteristics of well-designed projects. Attendees will learn about the attributes of well-designed
              humanities crowdsourcing projects and will be able to apply these lessons by designing and critiquing a
              simple crowdsourced task based on their own materials or projects.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>No technical or design experience is necessary but knowledge of potential or existing audiences for any

            <h3 class="h4">Description</h3>
            <p>This tutorial will present state­ of ­the ­art methods for querying data, from textual to multimodal,
              with a focus on use cases commonly found in digital humanities, or envisioned for the near future of
              this expanding field. It will be taught by two specialists in markup languages and corpus linguistics,
              currently involved in the process of creating a new analysis platform designed to handle large amounts
              of linguistic data. This is not meant to be a tutorial just for linguists, however: we intend to provide
              an opportunity to carry over some well­ known methods and techniques from linguistic research, where
              they have been used for years, onto the broader area of digital humanities, where queries target not
              only texts, but also non­textual objects, such as binary streams, ontologies, prosopographic databases
              or GIS data (these latter types of objects will be discussed to the extent to which they can be linked
              from textual resources).</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Audience</h3>
            <p>We intend the tutorial for general DH audience: variety is a virtue in this case, because we want to
              address actual use cases, some of which will surely come from the participants themselves.</p>
